# Course description

How do texts make their way from premodern authors to today's readers? This seminar is an introduction to the methods that allow us to understand this process: palaeography, textual criticism, and codicology. You will learn to read and identify the most important forms of handwriting and abbreviations used in Latin manuscripts between the fourth and fifteenth centuries. You will also understand how the process of copying by hand changed texts as we read them today, and the fundamentals of how modern scholars create a critical edition. These skills are essential for anyone wishing to conduct original research on classical and medieval primary sources. We will consider both traditional approaches to these subjects as well as evolving digital techniques.

Suggested prerequisite: two years' study of Latin or equivalent.

# Learning outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to demonstrate your ability, at an introductory level, to:

- Transcribe and translate Latin texts recorded in book hands between the fifth to fifteenth centuries; identify and broadly date these scripts.
- Use the principles of textual criticism to analyse the transmission of texts and reconstruct their meaning.
- Apply analysis of the physical structures of manuscripts, either in person or from modern catalogues, to the interpretation of primary sources.
- Understand the relationship between premodern and digital text, applying the basic text handling techniques established through Unicode, Unix, and text editors; and using a version control system to manage changes to digital documents (with GitHub).
- Edit and publish premodern texts in printed and online forms, using the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) guidelines to record standardized interpretations of textual elements.

In short, this course enables you to read a medieval manuscript and use it for original research in a digital context.

# Course materials

Supporting the in-class assignments, we will read these books over the course of the term, which you can use either online or in printed form:

- L.D. Reynolds and N.G. Wilson, *Scribes and Scholars: A Guide to the Transmission of Greek and Latin Literature,* 4th ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013).
- R.J. Tarrant, [*Texts, Editors, and Readers: Methods and Problems in Latin Textual Criticism,*](https://doi.org/cxkv) Roman Literature and Its Contexts (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2016).

You will also want to master the following reference works on Western palaeography:

- Bernhard Bischoff, [*Latin Palaeography: Antiquity and the Middle Ages,*](https://doi.org/gd6cws) trans. Daibhm O. Cróinin and David Ganz (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990).
- Michelle P. Brown, *A Guide to Western Historical Scripts from Antiquity to 1600* (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1990).
- Albert Derolez, *The Palaeography of Gothic Manuscript Books: From the Twelfth to the Early Sixteenth Century,* Cambridge Studies in Palaeography and Codicology 9 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003).

You will want to make use of a dictionary for expanding abbreviations. Generations of manuscripts scholars have grown up with Cappelli's:

- Adriano Cappelli, *Lexicon abbreviaturarum: Dizionario di abbreviature latine ed italiane,* 6th ed., Manuali Hoepli (Milan: Hoepli, 1961).

The University of Zurich now hosts an updated [digital Cappelli](https://www.adfontes.uzh.ch/en/ressourcen/abkuerzungen/cappelli-online). I also use Olaf Pluta's [Abbreviationes](http://abbreviationes.net), available through the University of Toronto subscription. Where these fail, Marjorie Burghart's [Enigma](http://enigma.huma-num.fr) is a wonderful resource for finding Latin words.

This work is a convenient reference for manuscript terminology:

- Michelle P. Brown, *Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts: A Guide to Technical Terms* (London: British Library, 1994), <https://bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/glossary.asp>.
