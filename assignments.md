Assessment is weighted as follows:

10%
: Participation

35%
: Weekly transcriptions (due 17:00 Thursdays)

10%
: Manuscript collation (due 27 February)

15%
: Group edition draft (due 15 March)

30%

All assignments must be submitted in either English or French through Quercus. Any citation style may be used in this course as long as it is consistent: I recommend either the [*MHRA Style Guide*](http://mhra.org.uk/style) or the [*Chicago Manual of Style*](https://chicagomanualofstyle.org).

## Participation

As a seminar, this course can only function with your contribution. In each class, we will take up the previous week's transcription exercises, read an additional passage without preparation, and discuss the historical development of scripts and textual transmission based on the assigned readings.

## Weekly transcriptions

Every week, you will transcribe passages from two manuscripts using the TEI markup demonstrated in-class. See my page on [Getting started with editing TEI XML using Atom
](https://andrewdunning.ca/getting-started-editing-tei-xml-atom) to download the software for this. The class [TEI transcription template](../assets/transcription-template.xml) provides a framework for your submissions.

## Collation exercise

As a preliminary to the final project, you will make three transcriptions of the same text and make a small critical edition showing the differences between them.

## Group edition

We will create, as a group, an introduction, edition, and translation of a Latin text that we will select in the second week of term, and submit it for publication at the end of the year. You will be personally responsible for one portion of the text as well as reviewing your peers' work, based on an initial draft.

## Analytical writing rubric

I will grade your written work based on a set of six criteria.
