Assessment is weighted as follows:

10%
: Participation

30%
: Weekly transcriptions (due every Wednesday)

5%
: Collation exercise (due 13 March)

30%
: Final project (due 5 April)

25%
: Final examination (finals period)

All assignments must be submitted in either English or French through Quercus. Any citation style may be used in this course as long as it is consistent: I recommend either the [*MHRA Style Guide*](http://mhra.org.uk/style) or the [*Chicago Manual of Style*](https://chicagomanualofstyle.org).

## Participation

This is a seminar course, which can only function with your contribution. In each class, we will take up the previous week's transcription exercises, read an additional passage without preparation, and discuss the historical development of scripts and textual transmission based on the assigned readings.

## Weekly transcriptions

Every week, you will transcribe passages from two manuscripts using the TEI markup demonstrated in-class. These files are due at the end of the Wednesday before each class (allowing me time to mark them before we review them in class on Friday).

## Collation exercise

As a preliminary to the final project, you will make three transcriptions of the same text and make a small critical edition showing the differences between them. This will replace the transcription exercises for the week leading up to 15 March.

## Final project

Your final project will consist of an introduction and edition to an excerpt of a text of your choosing.

## Final examination

The final examination will test your ability to identify and date scripts; expand abbreviations; and interpret textual transmission.

## Analytical writing rubric

The final paper is given a grade out of 100 points, based on a set of six criteria.
