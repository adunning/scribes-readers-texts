## Communication

You are always welcome to drop by with questions during office hours; I am available at other times by appointment. I usually respond to email messages by the end of the next business day. I will occasionally send course announcements to your University of Toronto email address.

## Late work

Assignments will only be accepted after the deadline with prior permission. Except in documented emergencies, you must request this at least 48 hours in advance via email.

## Academic integrity

Honesty and fairness are fundamental to learning and the free exchange of ideas. The [University of Toronto Academic Integrity website](https://academicintegrity.utoronto.ca) outlines your rights and responsibilities under its [Code of Student Conduct](http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/studentc.htm) and [Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters](http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/behaveac.htm).

## Accessibility and support

If I can help you to succeed through academic accommodations, please see me and contact [Accessibility Services](http://www.studentlife.utoronto.ca/as) as soon as possible. See the ['How are you feeling today?'](http://www.studentlife.utoronto.ca/hwc/feeling) page for an outline of the many other services available on campus and in the community.

The [St Michael’s College Writing Centre](https://stmikes.utoronto.ca/library/services/students/writing/) offers training in writing and speaking to all students.
